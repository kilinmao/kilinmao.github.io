Hello lovely readers,

Welcome to the very first post of my blog! 🎉 As a curious explorer in this vast universe, I've decided to embark on a new adventure by sharing my thoughts, experiences, and discoveries in this cozy little corner of the internet.

Do you ever find yourself wandering through life, pondering the mysteries of the world around us? That's me in a nutshell! My name is Kilin Mao, and I am your friendly, neighborhood adventurer, equipped with an insatiable appetite for learning.

In this blog, you can expect to read about an eclectic mix of topics—ranging from my travels ✈️ to the most remote corners of the globe 🌍, my culinary escapades in search of mouth-watering delights 🍽️, the exciting world of ACG 🎮, and even some insights into the captivating novels that keep me up late into the night 🌙. Furthermore, as a Front-end Engineer, I'll also be sharing some technical articles 💻 on topics such as computer graphics, image processing, and WebGL development.

Life is full of surprises, and sometimes, the most amazing discoveries arise from the most unexpected encounters. As I share my stories, I invite you to join me on this fantastic journey by sending emails, or adding my Wechat, and perhaps even sharing some of your own adventures.

Imagine sitting around a virtual campfire , exchanging tales of daring feats, hilarious mishaps , and heartwarming moments 💖, all while learning something new from time to time.
